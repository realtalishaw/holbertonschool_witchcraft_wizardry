Potions: A Pratical Magic
Written by Ada Lovelace
Potions are the heart and core of any and all spells. Without Potions, most spells would be useless.
One of the most important potions you can learn is cut and translate.
In fact if you translate this book to [something] you'll have the answer to your next Potions class!
